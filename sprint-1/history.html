        Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed. As with other influential inventions such as radio, television, the light bulb, and the computer, several inventors pioneered experimental work on voice transmission over a wire and improved on each other's ideas. New controversies over the issue still arise from time to time. Charles Bourseul, Antonio Meucci, Johann Philipp Reis, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray, amongst others, have all been credited with the invention of the telephone.

    In 1876, shortly after Bell's patent application, Hungarian engineer Tivadar Pusk√°s proposed the telephone switch, which allowed for the formation of telephone exchanges, and eventually networks.
